// queue has feature of FIFO

// With array - push/shift is good approach as rebalance not required
// Using liked list - enqueue/dequeue is good approach as we do not need to traverse to last node


// Queue class
class Queue
{
	// Array is used to implement a Queue
	constructor()
	{
		// lets create an empty aary
		this['items'] = [];
		this['size'] = 0;
	}
				
	// enqueue(item)
	// dequeue()
}
